		<h3>Bio</h3>
		Hi! My name is Eli.
		I am in my senior year studying computer science and cybersecurity at George Fox University.
		I am a security-focused software engineer passionate about test-driven development
		and lean methodologies. I excel in crafting carefully considered approaches to
		solving problems. I am an excellent communicator and user-focused developer
		guided by the belief that software is a process, not a product.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		When I'm not writing code or debugging my drivers,
		I am also an avid classical pianist and enjoyer of the outdoors.
		If you would like to get in contact, I'd love to connect. Please feel free to reach out to me at
	    <a href="mailto:eliascarljohnson@gmail.com" class="inline-link">eliascarljohnson@gmail.com</a>.

		But enough about me, let's take a look at the skills that I bring to a team.
	  </p>

		<h3>Development</h3>
		I have professional experience following <span class="highlight">Agile</span> methodologies
		and <span class="highlight">Lean</span> principles.
		I am a big believer in the effectiveness and efficiency of
		<span class="highlight">Test-Driven Development</span>,
		with hands-on experience writing test suites, including
		<span class="highlight">unit</span> and <span class="highlight">integration</span> testing.
		I have a background working individually as well as <span class="highlight">pair programming</span>
		and <span class="highlight">mobbing</span> with a team of developers.
	  </p>

	  <p>
		<h3>Programming Languages</h3>
		I am experienced in a number of programming languages,
		as well as paradigms such as <span class="highlight">object-oriented</span>,

	  </p>

	  <p>
		<h3>Tools</h3>
		I am well-versed in version control using <span class="highlight">Git</span>.
		I have experience with CI/CD by automating builds and tests through <span class="highlight">GitLab Pipelines</span>.
		I have also tested endpoints and API using <span class="highlight">Postman</span>.
		As far as collaboration tools, I have utilized
		<span class="highlight">JIRA</span> for ticket management, <span class="highlight">Jama</span> for documenting bugs,
		and <span class="highlight">Mural</span> to illustrate mockups and workflows.
	  </p>

      <p>
		<h3>Databases</h3>
		I am proficient in the usage of <span class="highlight">SQL</span>,
		along with designing, building, and deploying
		database management systems (DBMS) such as <span class="highlight">PostgreSQL</span>,
		and NoSQL databases like <span class="highlight">DynamoDB</span>.
	  </p>

	  <p>
		<h3>Networking</h3>
		I have integrated <span class="highlight">RESTful APIs</span> into numerous personal and professional projects.
		I also have scholastic experience designing network topologies and subnetting complex networks.
		I am very familiar with the protocol stack and the usage of numerous important internet protocols.
	  </p>

	  <p>
		<h3>Cloud</h3>
		I have experience building an application using services from <span class="highlight">AWS</span>,
		including <span class="highlight">DynamoDB</span> to store data,
		<span class="highlight">API Gateway</span> to interact with our hardware,
		<span class="highlight">Lambda</span> for server-side operations,
		and <span class="highlight">Lightsail</span> to host the web application.
		I also have professional experience interacting with <span class="highlight">Azure</span>
		and designing and deploying Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using <span class="highlight">Terraform</span>.
	  </p>

	  <p>
		<h3>Data Analysis</h3>
		I've worked with <span class="highlight">NumPy</span> and <span class="highlight">Pandas</span>
		to perform analysis on large quantities of data and <span class="highlight">Matplotlib</span>
		to plot and display my findings.
		I am also familiar training simple machine-learning models using
		<span class="highlight">scikit-learn</span> to gain further insight to the data.
	  </p>

	  <p>
		<h3>Cybersecurity</h3>
		I have competed in the National Cyber League (NCL) for the last three semesters.
		This past semester I placed <span class="highlight">478</span> out of <span class="highlight">8573</span> in the
		<a href="/assets/NCL_Spring2025_Individual.pdf" target="_blank" class="inline-link"><span>individual game</span></a>
		and <span class="highlight">51</span> out of <span class="highlight">4779</span> in the
		<a href="/assets/NCL_Spring2025_Team.pdf" target="_blank" class="inline-link"><span>team game</span></a>.
		Along with my peers at Fox, I also competed in the National Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition (NCCDC)
		this year where we placed <span class="highlight">16th</span> in the nation.
		<!-- Maybe put more here? -->
	  </p>

	  <p>
		<h3>Operating Systems</h3>
		I am very comfortable operating <span class="highlight">Windows</span>,
		<span class="highlight">MacOS</span>, and <span class="highlight">Linux</span>.
		I have also ran a number of different Linux virtual machines, including
		Ubuntu, Kali, and Debian.
	  </p>

	  <p>
		<h3>Text Editors</h3>
		If I can type in it, then I'm happy.
		I do most of my work using <span class="highlight">VS Code</span>
		due to it being a relatively lightweight IDE.
		However, I'm also quite comfortable using simple text editors such as
		<span class="highlight">Vim</span>,
		and heavyweight IDEs such as <span class="highlight">IntelliJ</span>.
