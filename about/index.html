	    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey there! My name is Eli. I am a motivated and diligent student at George Fox University. 
		My interests lie in computer science, software engineering, and cybersecurity. 
		I am in my junior year at George Fox University, majoring in computer science with a concentration in cybersecurity. 
		I am a team player, skilled communicator, and leader with a passion to serve.
		I am currently working as a software engineer intern for
		<a href="https://www.a-dec.com/" target="_blank" class="inline-link"><span>A-dec</span></a>.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am proficient in Python, Scala, Java, and C++. 
		I also have experience with JavaScript, MIPS assembly, and scripting languages such as Bash, Batch, and AWK.
		I am experienced operating CLI and GUI systems, and am comfortable programming in both advanced IDEs and plain text editors.
	  </p>
      <p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For backend development, I am experienced in SQL and DBMSs.
		I worked with a small team of my peers to design and implement our own PostgreSQL database for a class project.
	    For frontend development, I have experience with vanilla HTML and CSS.
		All of my experience in HTML and CSS has been from developing this website.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For networking, I have completed various school projects involving subnetting, network design and topology, and routing algorithms. 
		I am also very familiar with the protocol stack and many common internet protocols. 
	  </p>
	  <p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the development process, I am well-versed in the usage of Gitlab and Agile development processes. 
		I also have experience interpreting and writing diagrams such as UML and ER.
		I'm most experienced operating Windows OS and Linux distributions such as Ubuntu and Debian, but I do have some MacOS capabilities too. 
		I also have some experience building IOT devices and am currently in the process of developing one this semester.
      </p>
	  <p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have competed in the National Cyber League (NCL) for two semesters. Last semester I placed 757th out of 8482 in the 
		<a href="/assets/NCL_Fall2024_Individual.pdf" target="_blank" class="inline-link"><span>individual game</span></a> and 154th out of 4898 in the 
		<a href="/assets/NCL_Fall2024_Team.pdf" target="_blank" class="inline-link"><span>team game</span></a> with my peers at Fox. 
		From NCL, some of the areas I've gotten familiar with are network traffic analysis, forensics, cryptography, log analysis, and web exploitation.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my wife, hiking and other outdoor adventures, playing piano, and working on personal projects.
