	  <h3>Bio</h3>
	  <p>
		Hey there! My name is Eli. I am a motivated and diligent student 
		in my senior year studying computer science and cybersecurity at George Fox University. 
		My interests lie in software engineering and cybersecurity. 
		I am a team player, skilled communicator, and leader with a passion to serve.
		I am currently working as a software engineer intern for
		<a href="https://www.a-dec.com/" target="_blank" class="inline-link"><span>A-dec</span></a>.

      <p>
		For backend development, I am experienced in SQL and DBMSs.
		I worked with a small team of my peers to design and implement our own PostgreSQL database for a class project.
	    For frontend development, I have experience with vanilla HTML and CSS.
		All of my experience in HTML and CSS has been from developing this website.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		For networking, I have completed various school projects involving subnetting, network design and topology, and routing algorithms. 
		I am also very familiar with the protocol stack and many common internet protocols. 
	  </p>
	  <p>
		As for the development process, I am well-versed in the usage of Gitlab and Agile development processes. 
		I also have experience interpreting and writing diagrams such as UML and ER.
		I'm most experienced operating Windows OS and Linux distributions such as Ubuntu and Debian, but I do have some MacOS capabilities too. 
		I also have some experience building IOT devices and am currently in the process of developing one this semester.
      </p>
	  <p>
		I have competed in the National Cyber League (NCL) for two semesters. Last semester I placed 757th out of 8482 in the 
		<a href="/assets/NCL_Fall2024_Individual.pdf" target="_blank" class="inline-link"><span>individual game</span></a> and 154th out of 4898 in the 
		<a href="/assets/NCL_Fall2024_Team.pdf" target="_blank" class="inline-link"><span>team game</span></a> with my peers at Fox. 
		From NCL, some of the areas I've gotten familiar with are network traffic analysis, forensics, cryptography, log analysis, and web exploitation.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my wife, hiking and other outdoor adventures, playing piano, and working on personal projects.
		If you would like to get in contact with me, I'd love to connect! Please feel free to reach me at
