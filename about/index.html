        <h3>Bio</h3>
        Hi! My name is Eli. I am in my senior year studying computer science and cybersecurity at George Fox University.
        I am a security-first software engineer passionate about people and product. Comfortable developing anywhere along the stack,
        I have experience designing and implementing web and mobile applications, data-intensive pipelines, and cloud infrastructure.
        With background writing intensive automated tests, I am attentive to long-term code quality and maintainability.
        I am an excellent communicator and user-focused engineer guided by the belief that software is more about people than code.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I'm not building something awesome or debugging my drivers,
        I am also an enjoyer of the outdoors and avid classical pianist.
        If you would like to get in contact, I'd love to connect. Please feel free to reach out to me at
        <a href="mailto:eliascarljohnson@gmail.com" class="inline-link">eliascarljohnson@gmail.com</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        But enough about me, let's take a look at the skills that I bring to a team.
      </p>

      <p>
        <h3>Development</h3>
        I have experience following <span class="highlight">Agile</span> methodologies
        and <span class="highlight">Lean</span> principles.
        I have hands-on experience writing
        <span class="highlight">unit</span>, <span class="highlight">integration</span>,
        and <span class="highlight">end-to-end</span> test suites.
        I have worked extensively with <span class="highlight">Python Behave</span> and
        <span class="highlight">Cypress</span> for automated end-to-end tests, along with
        <span class="highlight">Tap</span> and <span class="highlight">Jest</span> for unit tests.
        I have a background working individually as well as <span class="highlight">pair programming</span>
        and <span class="highlight">mobbing</span> with a team of developers.
      </p>

      <p>
        <h3>Programming Languages</h3>
        I am experienced in a number of programming languages,
        as well as paradigms such as <span class="highlight">object-oriented</span>,
        <span class="highlight">procedural</span>, and <span class="highlight">functional</span> programming.
        I am comfortable writing in
        <span class="highlight">C</span>,  <span class="highlight">C++</span>,
        <span class="highlight">Python</span>,  <span class="highlight">Java</span>,
        <span class="highlight">JavaScript</span>, <span class="highlight">Go</span>,
        <span class="highlight">Bash</span>, <span class="highlight">Scala</span>,
        <span class="highlight">Clojure</span>, and <span class="highlight">PHP</span>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <h3>Tools</h3>
        I am well-versed in version control using <span class="highlight">Git</span>.
        I have experience with CI/CD by automating builds and tests through <span class="highlight">GitLab Pipelines</span>.
        I have also tested endpoints and API using <span class="highlight">Postman</span>.
        As far as collaboration tools, I have utilized
        <span class="highlight">JIRA</span> for ticket management, <span class="highlight">Jama</span> for documenting bugs,
        and <span class="highlight">Mural</span> to illustrate mockups and workflows.
      </p>

      <p>
        <h3>Databases</h3>
        I am proficient in the usage of <span class="highlight">SQL</span>,
        along with designing, building, and deploying
        database management systems (DBMS) such as <span class="highlight">PostgreSQL</span>
        and <span class="highlight">MySQL</span>,
        and NoSQL databases like <span class="highlight">DynamoDB</span>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <h3>Networking</h3>
        I have integrated <span class="highlight">RESTful APIs</span> into numerous personal and professional projects.
        I also have scholastic experience designing network topologies and subnetting complex networks.
        I am very familiar with the protocol stack and the usage of numerous important internet protocols.
      </p>

      <p>
        <h3>Cloud</h3>
        I have experience building an application using services from <span class="highlight">AWS</span>,
        including <span class="highlight">DynamoDB</span> to store data,
        <span class="highlight">API Gateway</span> to interact with our hardware,
        <span class="highlight">Lambda</span> for server-side operations,
        and <span class="highlight">Lightsail</span> to host the web application.
        I also have professional experience interacting with <span class="highlight">Azure</span>
        and designing and deploying Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using <span class="highlight">Terraform</span>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <h3>Data Analysis</h3>
        I've worked with <span class="highlight">NumPy</span> and <span class="highlight">Pandas</span>
        to perform analysis on large quantities of data and <span class="highlight">Matplotlib</span>
        to plot and display my findings.
        I am also familiar training simple machine-learning models using
        <span class="highlight">scikit-learn</span> to gain further insight to the data.
      </p>

      <p>
        <h3>Cybersecurity</h3>
        I have competed in the National Cyber League (NCL) for the last three semesters.
        This past fall I placed <span class="highlight">230th</span> out of <span class="highlight">7815</span> competitors in the
        Individual game.
        Along with my peers at Fox, I also competed in the National Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition (NCCDC)
        this year where we placed <span class="highlight">16th</span> in the nation.
        <!-- Maybe put more here? -->
      </p>

      <p>
        <h3>Operating Systems</h3>
        I am very comfortable operating <span class="highlight">Windows</span>,
        <span class="highlight">MacOS</span>, and <span class="highlight">Linux</span>.
        For Linux, I have run Debian, Ubuntu, and Kali in VMs and am currently running
        native Arch on my personal machine.
      </p>

      <p>
        <h3>Text Editors</h3>
        I do most of my work using <span class="highlight">VS Code</span>
        due to it being a relatively lightweight IDE.
        However, I'm also quite comfortable using simple text editors such as
        <span class="highlight">Vim</span>,
        and heavyweight IDEs such as <span class="highlight">IntelliJ</span>.
