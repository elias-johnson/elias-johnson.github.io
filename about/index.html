			  I am a motivated and diligent student at George Fox University. 
			  My interests lie in computer science, software engineering, and cybersecurity. 
			  I am in my junior year at George Fox University, majoring in computer science with a concentration in cybersecurity. 
			  I am a team player, skilled communicator, and leader with a passion to serve.

			  I am proficient in Python, Scala, Java, and C++. 
			  I also have experience with JavaScript, MIPS assembly, and scripting languages like Bash, Batch, and AWK.
			  I am very comfortable operating command-line and GUI systems, and am capable of programming in 
			  both plain text editors and IDEs such as IntelliJ.
			</p>
			<p>
			  For backend development, I am experienced in SQL and DBMSs and have created databases through PostgreSQL. 
			  For frontend development, I have practice using core HTML and CSS. 
			</p>
			<p>
			  For networking, I have completed various school projects involving subnetting, network design, and routing algorithms. 
			  I am also very familiar with the protocol stack and many common internet protocols. 
			</p>
			<p>
			  As far as development goes, I am well-versed in the usage of Gitlab and agile development processes. 
			  I also have experience interpreting and writing diagrams such as UML and ER.
			  I'm most experienced operating Windows OS and Linux distributions such as Ubuntu and Debian, but I do have some MacOS capabilities too. 
			  I also have some experience operating IOT devices and am currently in the process of developing two for class projects this year.
			</p>
			<p>
			  I have competed in the National Cyber League (NCL) for the past two semesters. This semester I placed 757th out of 8482 in the 
			  <a href="/utilites/NCL_Fall2024_Individual.pdf"><span class="inline-link">individual game</span></a> and 154th out of 4898 in the 
			  <a href="/utilities/NCL_Fall2024_Team.pdf"><span class="inline-link">team game</span></a> with my peers at Fox. 
			  From NCL, some of the areas I've gotten familiar with are network traffic analysis, forensics, cryptography, log analysis, and web exploitation.
			</p>
			<p>
			  In my free time I enjoy spending time with my wife, working on personal projects, and playing piano.
