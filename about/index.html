			  I am a motivated and diligent student at George Fox University. 
			  My interests lie in computer science, software engineering, and cybersecurity. 
			  I am in my junior year at George Fox University, majoring in computer science with a concentration in cybersecurity. 
			  I am a team player, skilled communicator, and leader with a passion to serve.
			</p>

			  I am proficient in Python, Scala, Java, C++, and MIPS asm. 
			  I also have experience with Javascript, and scripting languages like Bash, Batch, and AWK.
			  I am very comfortable operating command-line, and while I do most of my coding on a plain-text editor, 
			  I have experience programming in IDEs.
			</p>
			<p>
			  For backend, I am experienced in SQL and DBMSs and have created databases through PostgreSQL. 
			  For frontend, I have practice using HTML and CSS. 
			</p>
			<p>
			  For networking, I have completed various school projects involving subnetting, network design, and routing algorithms. 
			  I am also very familiar with the protocol stack and many common internet protocols. 
			</p>
			<p>
			  As far as development goes, I am well-versed in the usage of Gitlab and agile development processes. 
			  I also have experience interpreting and writing diagrams such as UML and ER.
			  I'm most experienced operating WindowsOS and Linux distributions such as Ubuntu and Debian, but I do have some MacOS capabilities too. 
			  I also have some experience operating IOT devices and am currently in the process of developing two for class projects this year.
			</p>
			<p>
			  I have competed in the National Cyber League (NCL) for the past two semesters. This semester I placed 757th out of 8482 in the individual game 
			  and 154th out of 4898 in the team game with my peers at Fox. From NCL, some of the areas I've gotten familiar with are network traffic analysis, 
			  forensics, cryptography, log analysis, and web exploitation.
			</p>
			<p>
			  In my free time I enjoy spending time with my wife, working on personal projects, and playing piano.
